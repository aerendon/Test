#HTML Style Rules

###Document Type
Use HTML5.

HTML5 (HTML syntax) is preferred for all HTML documents: `<!DOCTYPE html>.`

(Itâ€™s recommended to use HTML, as text/html. Do not use XHTML. XHTML, as application/xhtml+xml, lacks both browser and infrastructure support and offers less room for optimization than HTML.)

Although fine with HTML, do not close void elements, i.e. write `<br>`, not `<br />`.

###HTML Validity
Use valid HTML where possible.

Use valid HTML code unless that is not possible due to otherwise unattainable performance goals regarding file size.

Use tools such as the W3C HTML validator to test.

Using valid HTML is a measurable baseline quality attribute that contributes to learning about technical requirements and constraints, and that ensures proper HTML usage.

```HTML
<!-- Not recommended -->
<title>Test</title>
<article>This is only a test.
```
```HTML
<!-- Recommended -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>Test</title>
<article>This is only a test.</article>
```
